Welcome to AutoBlocks, Adaptavist’s visual integration platform built to help you automate with Atlassian tools. Building integrations in AutoBlocks is primarily code-based, but within an innovative Blocks UI powered by Google Blockly. Rather than the usual tree file structures, JavaScript modules and files are represented by blocks inside of a workspace. Event Listeners (also known as triggers) and connections are also represented by blocks. Triggers and modules can be linked together and interchanged to define your logic flows. AutoBlocks’ scalable Cloud platform gives you everything you need to start building integrations immediately. Connections, authentication, and security are managed for you for Atlassian and selected third-party systems, so you can focus on the business logic to solve your most demanding challenges. AutoBlocks uses V8 Isolate technology and AWS Lambda for ultimate security and scalability.
